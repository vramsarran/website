    <h1>What is Mental Health?</h1>
    <div class="main">
      <p>
        Mental health is our social, psychological, and emotional well-being.
        The importance of mental health cannot be understated. It essentially
        effects every part of our lives, especially given that mental illnesses
        can lead to physical ails as well.
        <br >
        <br >

        You're not alone. Poor mental health and mental illnesses are common in
        the United States. Many mental illnesses can lead you to believe that
        nobody else could understand what you're experiencing or even cause you
        to believe that nobody cares. We care and we want to help you.
